## **Favorite Plot:**

Though it's not the favorite, but it's a funny one.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
df <- data.frame(type=c("Watery dribble","Not at all","The entire contant in one projectile splort","An effortless smooth flow"),percentage=c(33.33,33.33,33.34,0)) 
library(tidyverse) 
library(ggtext) 
df %>% ggplot(aes(x="",y=percentage,fill=type,))+   
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", width = 1,color = "black") +   
  coord_polar("y", start = 0) +   
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("yellow", "blue", "green", "red")) +    
  theme_void()+   ggtitle("How Ketchup comes out of a bottle",)+   
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=30),legend.text=element_text(size=rel(2)))
```
